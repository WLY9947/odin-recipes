    <h2>
    <p>You will need: Zucchini, chicken, alfredo sauce</p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Now we're getting into some gourmet shit. Chop up your zucchini because we staying away from carbohydrate mothafuckers. Or you can spiralize them like you fancy and shit.</li>
        <li>Bake or fry your chicken. If you haven't already, make sure you kill it first. I like to add salt and pepper for that bugs bunny flavor.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, pour some of that alfredo sauce on that bitch and lower your heat. </li>
        <li>Throw your zucchinis in and cover it with a lid, then let it cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put that shit onto a plate and eat it while you think about Arnold. That fucker was cumming at home, at work, at the gym, WTF.</li>
