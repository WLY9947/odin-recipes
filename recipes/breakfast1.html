    </h1>
    <h2>
    <p>You will need: Eggs, Bacon</p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Heat the mothafuckin pan up til it starts to smoke</li>
        <li>Place your bacon onto the fuckin pan. You will know it is hot enough if you hear the sizzling sound. This just means that the creature is screaming in agony.</li>
        <li>Lower the temperature to medium heat cook until your likened texture, flipping the bacon when necessary. Some people like their bacon raw and gross. It's whatever.</li>
        <li>Once the bacon is cooked, place onto a napkin to soak up the grease... Unless you're freaky like I am.</li>
        <li>Using the leftover bacon grease, crack some eggs and let it cook. The reason I do this is because I'm lazy as shit and ain't got time for bullshit.</li>
            </ol></p>
            <p>Of course, I hate following steps so let me sum it up</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong><em>Place bacon on hot pan, lower temp, cook bacon, cook eggs, eat the mothafucker. i usually like to follow up by either studying the fuck out of shit or destroying my biceps at the gym.</strong></em></p>
